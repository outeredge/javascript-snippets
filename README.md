* script should be placed before body end
* div must have id: ```cookiePopup```
* ```timesShown``` specifies the number of page loads before cookie is no longer incremented (and popup does not show)
* modify ```showCookiePopup()``` & ```hideCookiePopup()``` if you want smooth animations (css3 classes)
